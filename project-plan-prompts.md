**Backend Infrastructure:**
- Python programming language
- FastAPI framework for RESTful API development
- PostgreSQL relational database for data persistence

## Target Audience and Purpose

This platform is designed to serve cybersecurity learners who aim to master complex concepts and achieve professional certification within an accelerated timeframe of three months. The system addresses the growing demand for flexible, accessible cybersecurity education.

I want you to help me in each of phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), starting 
planning, designing, analyzing, building, testing and deploying.
