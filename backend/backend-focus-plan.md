## Project Overview
CyberEd Pro is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) designed specifically for cybersecurity education. The platform aims to provide an accelerated learning path for professionals and students seeking to advance their knowledge and obtain industry certifications within a three-month timeframe.
The site will allow teachers to add new courses, learners, interact with the core functionality of the application.
The teacher or instructor will be able to perform CRUD operations on all system resources after login.
An admin is responsible for controlling and managing this learning management system (LMS) with full rights to perform CRUD operations on 
all endpoints.

Examples of courses will be added to the website are, Security+, CEH, CISSP and other cybersecurity courses.

I'm building a small business appointment scheduler for local entrepreneurs like barbers, stylists, consultants, or tutors. This is only the frontend portion using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS. Please help me plan this application with the following:

1. Key features needed for a minimum viable product (MVP)
2. User stories for both business owners and clients
3. A simple data model for storing:
   - Business information
   - Service offerings
   - Appointments
   - Clients
4. Basic workflow for how the application should function
5. Technical considerations for a frontend using HTML, Alpine.js, and TailwindCSS

Don't create the code inside jupyter notebook. Show the code, one page at a time.

My technical knowledge is beginner-intermediate level with some understanding of HTML and basic database concepts.
