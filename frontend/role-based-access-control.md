I want you to suggest and generate a code that allow admin to manage and control this application.
Second, allow instructor/teacher to perform all the defined roles over students and coures.
third, a code that allows students to interact with application, like viewing posted coures, enroll in a new course,
and perform defined duties.
- Use html5 for structure, tailwind css for styling and alpine js for interactivity.
-  Make these pages professional and responsive 
- integrate header and footer of the index.html file
-  Allow searching and filtering of instructors that are added by admin, students that are added by instructor, 
- coures, and more.

Use-Cases:
-	Admin, Instructor, and student
-	Admin: I want this application to grant full access to all resources to perform CRUD operations and others functions on instructors and students.
-	It should be known that an admin has a right over instructor, and instructors have more rights/privilege over students.
-	Instructor: add course and students to the platform and perform generic operation on course and students as needed. Examples of instructor’s roles are:

-	Course: Syllabus, a full description about the course or a roadmap about the course. course should consist of modules, which also consist of lessons,

-	Example with CompTIA Security+ Certification Training:
a.	User management
b.	Course management
c.	Learning experiences
d.	Assessment system
e.	Communication and collaboration
f.	Analytics and Reporting: instructor dashboard: assigned course with ability to perform CRUD operation on courses. Enrolled students in each course with ability to assign assessments to students, a visual diagram about course
-	Visitor/guest: anyone who is not registered is a guest who can view the website, browser courses, add courses to cart, signup/register, pay for it, and have a private personal page with his enrolled course. Main functionality of visitor: model and schema:
a.	View the website
b.	Add to the cart interested course
c.	Calculate costs of completing the added courses
d.	view cart
e.	make a payment – integrate the app with the third-party payment gateway like paypall and stripe 
f.	Signup or register to be a member/create a personal profile
g.	Reset his/her password 
h.	Confirm sign-up and enroll in any course. Warning: any visitor can sign up to be a member without enrolling in any course.
i.	

-	Student: view enrolled course, assessments, Grades, upload homework/assignments, quiz, and more.

## Reponse:

I've created four comprehensive pages for the Learning Management System:
1. **Admin Dashboard**: A complete control center for administrators with statistics, user management, course overview, and analytics.
2. **Instructor Dashboard**: A dedicated interface for instructors to manage courses, track student progress, and monitor assessments.
3. **Student Dashboard**: A personalized learning environment for students to track progress, access courses, and manage their learning path.
4. **Course Management (Instructor)**: A powerful interface for instructors to create, edit, and manage their courses with filtering capabilities.
5. **User Management (Admin)**: A comprehensive tool for administrators to manage all users in the system with robust search and filtering.

Each page includes:
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Interactive functionality with Alpine.js
- Professional UI with consistent header and footer
- Role-based access control
- Data visualization where appropriate
- Search and filtering capabilities
- CRUD operations for respective entities

The pages maintain a consistent design language and integrate seamlessly with the provided backend API endpoints. They follow modern UI/UX principles and are optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.
