# Frontend API Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of the frontend with the backend API endpoints in the CyberEd Pro application. The integration uses the centralized API service (`js/api.js`) which provides caching, timeout handling, and retry mechanisms for improved performance and reliability.

## Changes Made

### API Service Enhancements

1. **Caching System**:
   - Added a caching mechanism for GET requests to reduce server load
   - Implemented cache invalidation for mutation operations
   - Set appropriate cache durations for different types of data:
     - User profile: Until invalidated
     - Courses list: 2 minutes
     - Course details: 5 minutes
     - Enrollments: 5 minutes

2. **Request Timeout Handling**:
   - Implemented `fetchWithTimeout` method to prevent UI from hanging
   - Set a default timeout of 10 seconds for all requests

3. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Implemented `fetchWithRetry` method with exponential backoff
   - Configured to retry failed requests up to 3 times
   - Added logging for retry attempts

4. **Centralized Request Handling**:
   - Refactored all API methods to use a common `request` method
   - Improved error handling and reporting

### Frontend Pages Integration

1. **Homepage (index.html)**:
   - Updated the Featured Courses section to use the API service's `getCourses` method
   - Updated the authentication store to use the API service's `getCurrentUser` method
   - Updated the login method to use the API service's `login` method

2. **Login Page (pages/login.html)**:
   - Already integrated with the API service
   - Uses the `login` and `getCurrentUser` methods for authentication and user data

3. **Student Dashboard (pages/student/dashboard.html)**:
   - Updated `fetchStudentData` to use the API service's `getCurrentUser` method
   - Updated `fetchEnrolledCourses` to use the API service's `getEnrollments` and `getCourse` methods
   - Updated `fetchRecommendedCourses` to use the API service's `getCourses` method
   - Added fallback to mock data for development and testing

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Reduced server load through caching
   - Faster response times for frequently accessed data

2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Timeout handling prevents UI from hanging
   - Retry mechanism handles transient network issues automatically

3. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Centralized API service makes it easier to update API endpoints
   - Consistent error handling across the application

4. **Development Flexibility**:
   - Fallback to mock data allows development and testing without a backend

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete API Integration**:
   - Integrate remaining pages (instructor dashboard, admin pages, etc.)
   - Implement remaining API endpoints (forums, assessments, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Implement offline mode with local storage

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add telemetry to track API request performance
   - Implement adaptive caching based on network conditions

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
