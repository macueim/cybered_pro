# CyberEd Pro - Cybersecurity Learning Management System

## Project Overview
CyberEd Pro is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) designed specifically for cybersecurity education. The platform aims to provide an accelerated learning path for professionals and students seeking to advance their knowledge and obtain industry certifications within a three-month timeframe.
The site will allow teacher to add new course,learner, interact with the core functionality of the application.
The teacher or instructor will be able to perform CRUD operations on all system resources after login.
example of coures will be added to the website are, Security+, CEH, and CISSP.

4. Develop authentication system prototype
5. Design and implement basic UI components


1. Examine the project structure to understand the codebase organization2. Review the backend code:- Check the FastAPI setup and routes- Examine database models and schemas- Verify authentication and authorization mechanisms3. Review the frontend code:- Check HTML structure and navigation- Verify CSS and JavaScript integration- Ensure role-based access control is implemented correctly4. Identify and fix any issues in the backend5. Identify and fix any issues in the frontend6. Test the application to ensure it works as expected7. Document the changes made and provide recommendations for further improvements
